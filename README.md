# Hamiltonian Cycle Visualization

## Project Overview

The Hamiltonian Cycle Visualization project is a Python application that visualizes the process of finding Hamiltonian cycles in a grid. It generates a visual representation of the cycle formation using matplotlib and saves each step as an image. These images are then compiled into a video to demonstrate the algorithm's progression.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:**
  - Python

- **Libraries and Frameworks:**
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - OpenCV

## Features

- **Dynamic Visualization:** Displays the step-by-step formation of Hamiltonian cycles in a grid.
- **Custom Dimensions:** Allows users to input custom grid dimensions for the visualization.
- **Image and Video Output:** Saves each step as an image and compiles these images into a video for easy viewing.

## Usage

1. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
